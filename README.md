# DataBaseCS
Created an app to manage an educational platform for a school. The app was created using C#, WPF and SQLServer.
The user interface is in romanian.
The objective of this project was to succesfully connect a SQL database to a C# app and to be able to succesfully modify it using the app.
It was structured on the MVVM model. On the app there are 3 types of users:
* Admins
